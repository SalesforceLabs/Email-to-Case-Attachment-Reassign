# Email-to-Case-Attachment-Reassign

Moves/copies email attachments on Email2Case emails from the email record to the parent Case record. By default, emails created in salesforce via Email2Case have any email attachments displayed in a related list on the email record, not on the Case record. This trigger will move all attachments in new Email2Case emails from the email to the case.

To install this package, your org must have the Email2Case feature enabled.
